# Workbench Traceability Matrix: Runbook ↔ Test Plans

**Date:** 2026-04-18
**Issue:** #80 — Audit runbook coverage against test plan
**Author:** Claude (Opus 4.6)

## Overview

This matrix maps every active runbook scenario to its corresponding test plan scenario(s), identifying coverage gaps in both directions.

- **Runbook**: `tests/workbench-test-runbook.md` — 144 active execution scenarios
- **UI Test Plan**: `tests/workbench-test-plan-ui.md` — 281 active scenarios (Gate C)
- **Backend Test Plan**: `tests/workbench-test-plan-backend.md` — 378 active scenarios (Gates A & B)

## 1. Runbook → Test Plan Mapping

Every runbook scenario should trace to at least one test plan scenario. Gaps = runbook tests with no plan backing.

### Phase 1: Smoke (3 tests)

| Runbook ID | Title | UI Plan | Backend Plan | Gap? |
|------------|-------|---------|--------------|------|
| SMOKE-01 | Page Load and Empty State | LAY-01, LAY-05, EMP-01, BRW-01, FR-01 | — | No |
| SMOKE-02 | Sidebar Projects Render | SB-01, SB-05, FLT-01, BRW-01 | — | No |
| SMOKE-03 | API Health and WebSocket | RCN-05, STB-06 | HLT-01, AUTH-01, SRV-03 | No |

### Phase 2: Core Workflows (11 tests)

**Total runbook gaps: ~33 scenarios missing from test plans**

---

## 3. Reverse Gap: Test Plan Scenarios Not in Runbook

These test plan scenarios exist but have no runbook execution steps. Since the runbook is for UI/browser execution on the HF Space, backend-only (Gates A & B) scenarios are expected to be absent. We focus only on UI plan scenarios missing from the runbook.

### UI Plan Scenarios Not Covered by Runbook

| Plan ID | Title | Category | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| LAY-01..05 | Layout structure tests | Layout | Low — covered implicitly by SMOKE-01 |
| INIT-01 | Inline initialization | Init | Low — covered implicitly by SMOKE-01 |
| FAIL-01..02 | Fetch error handling | Error | Medium — error paths untested |
| SB-08 | Hash-based skip optimization | Sidebar | Low |
| SB-09..11 | Missing project/session styling | Sidebar | Medium |
| SES-02 | Session actions on hover | Session | Low — implicit in other tests |
| SES-04 | Resume failure error (Mock) | Session | Medium |
| TAB-01 | Tab bar empty when no sessions | Tabs | Low |
| TAB-06 | Tab status indicator | Tabs | Medium |
| TIO-03..05 | Terminal resize, binary data | Terminal | Medium |
| CFG-04..07 | Config close/clear buttons | Config | Low |
| PNL-00 | Panel opened with no session | Panel | Low |
| PNL-02..03 | Panel tab switching, data load | Panel | Medium |
| FIL-05..06 | Mounts fallback, file read error | Files | Medium — error paths |
| FIL-09..10 | File viewer readonly, multi-mount | Files | Low |
| AUTH-01..10 | Auth flow (Mock) | Auth | Medium — only EDGE-05/20/21 cover this |
| STB-02..05 | Status bar model/mode/context details | Status | Low — FEAT-17 covers broadly |
| STB-08..10 | Status bar degraded, model shortening | Status | Medium |
| CTX-04 | Bar width matches percentage | Context | Low |
| RCN-04 | "No tmux session" stops reconnect | Reconnect | Medium |
| RCN-06 | Token update via WS (Mock) | Reconnect | Medium |
| RCN-08..10 | Close cancels reconnect, settings update, WS error | Reconnect | Medium |
| REF-01..04 | Auto-refresh timers | Refresh | Medium |
| KEY-01..05 | Keyboard shortcuts | Keyboard | Medium |
| VAL-01..06 | Input validation | Validation | Medium |
| RACE-01..03 | Temp ID race conditions | Race | Medium |
| MOD-01..04 | Modal overlap | Modal | Low — EDGE-10 covers |
| ESC-01..04 | XSS / HTML safety | Security | **High — not in runbook** |
| UI-ERR-01..02 | Button state / error recovery | Error | Medium |
| LIFE-01 | Tmux killed externally | Lifecycle | Medium — EDGE-11 covers |
| HR-01..04 | Hot-reload tests | Hot-reload | Medium |
| DND-04 | File browser links draggable | DnD | Low |

### High-Priority Reverse Gaps (should be added to runbook)

1. **ESC-01..04 (XSS/HTML Safety)** — Security tests not in runbook. Should add a Phase 4 edge case.
2. **FAIL-01..02 (Fetch Errors)** — Error recovery not exercised.
3. **KEY-01..05 (Keyboard Shortcuts)** — No runbook coverage of keyboard shortcuts.
4. **VAL-01..06 (Input Validation)** — No runbook coverage of validation edge cases.
5. **HR-01..04 (Hot-Reload)** — Not tested via runbook (deferred in old Phase 8).

---

## 4. Removed Feature Alignment

Both runbook and test plans correctly mark the same features as REMOVED:

| Feature | Runbook | UI Plan | Backend Plan | Aligned? |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|----------|
| Notes panel | FEAT-03, EDGE-12, EDGE-13 | NTS-01..04, BRW-10, BRW-38 | PRJ-05 (still exists), MCP-06d/e | **Partial** — PRJ-05/MCP-06o still reference notes via config, which is valid |
| Messages panel | FEAT-05 | MSG-01..02, BRW-12 | MSG-01..07 still listed | **Issue** — Backend plan MSG section not fully marked REMOVED |
| Quorum | NF-20, NF-32 | QRM-01..03 | QRM-01..15 all REMOVED | Yes |
| Smart compaction | EDGE-07, NF-30 | CST-01..20, BRW-31, CLI-21 | CMP-43 REMOVED | Yes |
| Terminal button | EDGE-17, NF-58 | UI-E19 REMOVED | — | Yes |
| Active dot | — | UI-E27 updated | — | Yes |
| Tasks toggle | — | FTR-01 REMOVED | — | Yes |
| Plan tools | NF-31..37 | — | MCP-06j/k REMOVED, FS-06 REMOVED | Yes |

### Issues Found

1. **Backend plan MSG section**: MSG-01..07 are still listed as active scenarios even though the messaging system was deleted. These should be marked REMOVED.
2. **Backend plan MCX section**: MCX-01..11 reference `mcp-external.js` which was deleted. All MCX scenarios should be marked REMOVED.
3. **Backend plan UI-24**: References "Notes tab: auto-save textarea" — should be marked REMOVED.
4. **Backend plan UI-26**: References "Messages tab: view and send" — should be marked REMOVED.
5. **Backend plan UI-40**: References "Quorum configuration" — should be marked REMOVED.
6. **Backend plan BRW-10**: References "Notes autosave" — should be marked REMOVED.
7. **Backend plan BRW-12**: References "Messages" — should be marked REMOVED.
8. **Backend plan BRW-31**: References "Compaction workflow" — should be marked REMOVED.
9. **Backend plan USR-02**: References "send message between sessions" — messaging deleted, needs rewrite.
10. **Backend plan CMP section**: Most CMP scenarios are still listed. While the underlying code functions may still exist for manual compaction via /compact, the smart compaction pipeline (CMP-11..42) is removed. The threshold/nudge tests (CMP-28..34, 46..50) and the checker/pipeline orchestration tests are dead code.

## 5. Consistency Issues

### ID Collisions Between Documents

The following ID prefixes are used in BOTH the UI plan and the runbook with potentially different meanings:

| Prefix | Runbook Usage | UI Plan Usage | Conflict? |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| CLI-01..21 | Phase 5 CLI tests | §9 CLI function tests | **Same IDs, same tests** — aligned |
| USR-01..07 | Phase 7 user stories | §8.36 usability tests | **Same IDs, same tests** — aligned |
| E2E-01 | Phase 6 daily loop | §8.35 daily loop | **Same ID, same test** — aligned |
| CFG-01..07 | Runbook session config | UI plan session config | Aligned |
| SET-01..07 | UI plan settings | Backend plan settings | Different scopes — OK |

No actual conflicts found. IDs are consistent across documents.

### Naming Inconsistencies

| Issue | Location | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Filter test | Runbook CORE-06 vs UI FLT-01 | Same test, different ID — expected (runbook uses phase-based IDs) |
| "Malory" reference | Runbook line 58 | Should be "Playwright MCP" not "Malory MCP tools" — stale reference |

---

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (for #80 closure)

1. **Add 33 missing test plan entries** to cover runbook scenarios with no plan backing (see Section 2)
2. **Mark MSG-01..07, MCX-01..11, and stale UI/BRW references** as REMOVED in the backend test plan
3. **Add XSS/security tests (ESC-01..04) to the runbook** as Phase 4 edge cases
4. **Fix "Malory" reference** in runbook to "Playwright MCP"

### Deferred Actions (for #81)

1. Audit existing test code files against the updated runbook
2. Remove/update stale test specs that reference deleted features
3. Create missing test spec files for new features (NF series)
